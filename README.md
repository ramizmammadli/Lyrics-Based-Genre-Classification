# Lyrics-Based-Genre-Classification
  As people have access to increasingly large music data, song classification becomes critical in this industry. Especially, automatic genre classification is an important feature in song classification and has attracted much attention in recent years. As it can be guessed, to tell which genre the song belongs to, we need to listen to the music of the song, as well as, read its lyrics. However, according to the recent researches, there can be a predictable connection between the lyrics of the songs. This project aims to build a system that can identify the genre of a song based on its lyrics. By using various Natural Language Processing techniques and tools, we developed a system that guesses the genre of the English songs based on its lyrics. There are five major genres in the program to classify the lyrics into: Rock, Pop, Jazz, Indie and Hip-Hop.
